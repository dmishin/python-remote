[ ] Support for the keyword arguments in call.
   ? Create separate function for calling method with keyword arguments? Wrapping and unwrapping dictionaries can be slow
[ ] Multithreading model:
  Main thread maintains a queue of messages.
  Server (separate thread) waits for connections and spawns service threads.
  Service threads receive messages and put them into the queue in the main thread.
  Main thread processes messages and puts them back to the server.
  
  Such mode would guarantee that all calls are perormed within the main Python thread.

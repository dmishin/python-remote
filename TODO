[ ] Support for the keyword arguments in the calls.
   ? Create separate function for calling method with keyword arguments? Wrapping and unwrapping dictionaries can be slow
[ ] Multithreading model:
  Main thread maintains a queue of messages.
  Server (separate thread) waits for connections and spawns service threads.
  Service threads receive messages and put them into the queue in the main thread.
  Main thread processes messages and puts them back to the server.
  
  Such mode would guarantee that all calls are perormed within the main Python thread.
[ ] Safe marshalling of the remote exceptions:
  Now exceptions are transmitted as-is, without any kind of wrapping
  This can cause problem, if exception object is not trivial.
  Better solution is to use special approach for exception transfer:
  first serialize it to string, and if failed - serialize as "UntranslatableException"

[ ] Pluggable codecs:
  instead of pickel anc cPickle, make othe codecs possible:
   - XML
   - JSON
   - something else?
